-four_in_a_row.py:
    run the game by cally the constructor of GUI
-ex12:
    -game.py:
        in this file we have the class Game that represents the logic of the
        game. i would like to specify here that we made the  win_coordination
         function for the GUI to have the coordination of the four aligned
         disks and place the star in our grid
    -ai.py:
        in this file we have the class AI.we explain the logic of the ai
        functionnment in the special comments
    -gui.py:
        in this file we have the class GUI that represents the graphical
        interface

======================
we will explain here how our ai works:
at each moment we want that the ai plays we check each possible 'scenario' on
the 4 following strokes(for that we use the function product from itertool).
if a scenario makes the ai wins we are increasing the value that correspond to
the first move in our col_dic of this scenario (each move is a coloumn) by 1000
in the same way if a scneario makes the ai loses we are decreasing the value
that correspond to the first move of this scenarion by 1000. if a scenario
makes the ai moves at the first stroke we are increasing the value that
correspond to this col by 200000 to prioritize the move that will make the
ai wins directly.
how we deal with the param timeout:
we tests many times how long our function takes to execute with the module
time. for example we see that if we want to check for the 4 following strokes
our ai takes maximum 3 seconds so if we stop our find_legal_move() after 3 sec
the function has the time to checks all the scenario for the 4 following
strokes. depending on the runtime of our function we decide that if timeout is
smaller than 3000 and bigger than 300 the function will checks all the scenario
for the 3 following stokes. if smaller than 300 and bigger than 50 the 2
following strokes if smaller than 50 just one stoke
